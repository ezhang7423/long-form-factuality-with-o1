The experiment was conducted in 1968 by John Darley and Bibb Latane at Columbia University.\n\nIn the experiment, participants were placed in a room and told they were part of a discussion group via intercom. They were asked to discuss personal problems and were told that there were either two or five other participants in the group. At one point during the discussion, a staged emergency occurred where a participant pretended to have a seizure.\n\nThe results of the experiment showed that when there were more people in the group, individuals were less likely to intervene and help the person having a seizure. This phenomenon was attributed to the diffusion of responsibility, where individuals in a group feel less personally responsible for taking action because they believe someone else will do it.\n\nOne specific example from the experiment was when a participant named Mary was in a group with five other people and the staged emergency occurred. Despite Mary being the only one who knew the emergency was fake, she hesitated to intervene because she assumed someone else would take charge.\n\nThe Bystander Effect Experiment highlighted the importance of individual responsibility in social situations and how group dynamics can influence decision-making. It has since been used to explain real-world events where people fail to help others in need due to the presence of others.

The construction of the Great Wall was carried out by various Chinese dynasties, with each dynasty adding their own sections and making improvements to the existing wall. Some of the most significant construction efforts were undertaken by the Qin, Han, and Ming dynasties.\n\n3. The first Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang, is often credited with initiating the construction of the Great Wall. During his reign in the 3rd century BC, he ordered the connection of existing walls along China's northern border to form a unified defense system against invasions from nomadic tribes.\n\n4.

Some sections of the wall were built using rammed earth and wood, while others were built using bricks and stone.\n\n8. The purpose of the Great Wall was to protect China's northern border from invasions by nomadic tribes such as the Mongols and Xiongnu.
